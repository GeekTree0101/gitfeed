# Gitfeed

A github api example flutter project.

## Personally well-written flutter pubs ðŸ˜‹
- flutter_platform_widgets: the convenience of developing apps for Android and iOS at the same time.
- ionicons: simple icon assets
- provider: it was much better to use than bloc.
- pull_to_refresh: it most satisfactorily among the pull to refresh pubs.
- fluttertoast: very simple. but, accessibility was not good.
- flutter_swipe_action_cell: it's not free to form, but it's pretty useful.

## The github auth token is exposed in the source code. ðŸ˜±
Don't worry :] It has already expired.
